## 🏛️ Core Philosophy

> **The world is dynamic. Knowledge is provisional. Emergence is the norm.**

This isn't a slogan. It's the operating system that runs through every line of code, every search query, and every paper analysis in this project.

### Three Tenets

**🌍 The World Is Dynamic**
R packages update. Species distributions shift. Scientific consensus evolves. Climate change reshapes ecosystems. A correct conclusion today may be obsolete in six months. **We treat no knowledge as eternal truth** — everything is anchored on a timeline.

**📖 Knowledge Is Provisional**
The bedrock of science is falsifiability (Popper). No finding is final — only "the best current explanation." We use **calibrated language**: say "evidence suggests" not "proves," say "Smith (2022) found" not "studies show." Every output carries a timestamp.

**🔬 Emergence Is the Norm**
Life, consciousness, ecosystems, AI reasoning — all are **emergent** phenomena. Analyzing parts in isolation never reveals the whole. When ≥3 independent sources point to the same unexpected pattern, the system flags it as an **emergence signal** — not dismisses it as noise.

### Why This Matters for Research

| Risk | Traditional Approach | Dynamic Worldview Approach |
|:-----|:--------------------|:---------------------------|
| **Stale knowledge** | Run 2020 code on 2026 data | Auto-check CRAN versions, mark "verified on glmmTMB v1.1.10" |
| **Overconfidence** | "Research shows X" | "Smith (2022) found X, but Jones (2024) added Y" |
| **Ignoring signals** | Dismiss outliers as noise | ≥3 independent sources → emergence signal, actively tracked |
| **Frozen docs** | Handbook never updated | Verification log with "next review" date, calculated from package activity |


Energy is finite. Computation has a cost. DeepSeek does not scale parameters — it scales algorithms. This project applies the same engineering philosophy in four concrete implementations:

**Entropy budget** — In research-orchestrator, every pipeline stage has an explicit activation condition. PhD thesis: full pipeline. Casual query: single-step search. Compute is allocated proportionally to question importance.

**Sparse activation** — karpathy-guard defines MoE-style routing rules. Planner always runs (lightweight). Executor only with queries. Analyst only with results. Writer only with findings. Each module is a silent neuron — it fires only when the signal crosses threshold.

**Differential verification** — verify-stats-handbook never runs full checks. Probabilistic stale scoring P(stale) targets only changed packages. Review cycles are jointly determined by update frequency, breaking-change probability, and user dependency — not a fixed 3 months.

**Information-gain routing** — ima-smart-search orders keywords by information gain. P0 exact terms (e.g., glmmTMB) searched first, stops on hit. P2 redundant terms (e.g., data analysis) skipped. Cross-KB deduplication eliminates wasted reads.

Not brute force. Logic. Not more parameters. Smarter algorithms.

## 🤔 What Is This

**Fish Ecology Assistant** transforms [Reasonix Code](https://github.com/esengine/deepseek-reasonix) from a general-purpose coding agent into a **domain-specialized fish ecology research team** — with 16 integrated MCP tools, 12 AI subagents, a 5-stage auto-orchestrated research pipeline, R statistics, and 13 connected knowledge bases. All outputs follow the dynamic worldview above.

| Capability | Vanilla Reasonix | **With This Config** |
|:-----------|:----------------:|:--------------------:|
| Search engines | 1 | **5** (tavily, exa, scholar, article, scholarly) |
| MCP services | 0 | **16** |
| AI subagents | 4 (generic) | **12** (domain-specialized, with emergence detection) |
| R statistics | — | ✅ R 4.6.0 + 20+ ecology packages |
| OCR | — | ✅ PaddleOCR + Tesseract.js |
| Reference manager | — | ✅ Direct Zotero SQL queries |
| Research pipeline | — | ✅ 5-stage + auto-review + emergence detection |
| Knowledge bases | — | ✅ 13 ima knowledge bases connected |
| Setup on new machine | Manual | ✅ One script, 5 minutes |

## 🐋 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fangtaocai041/fish-ecology-assistant.git
cd fish-ecology-assistant
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .reasonix\setup-migrate.ps1
```

Restart Reasonix — everything is ready.

### Say This, Get That

| Say this | What happens |
|:---------|:-------------|
| `"Research Yangtze fishing ban effects on fish — run full pipeline"` | 5 stages: plan → search → analyze → write → review (bilingual EN/CN, auto emergence signals) |
| `"Verify handbook chapter 2.2"` | Auto-check CRAN versions, compare with handbook, calculate next review date |
| `"Search my ima knowledge bases for stable isotope niche"` | Auto-route to correct KBs, parallel search, synthesize results |
| `"Help me with a mixed effects model"` | R code + method selection + diagnostics, annotated "as of YYYY-MM recommended practice" |
